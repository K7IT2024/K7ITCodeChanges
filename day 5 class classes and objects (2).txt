classes and Objects:
=================================

class: it is a real time entity or class is a factory of objects. 

   it is act like catagory.  we can't touch or we cant see the catogies.

real time entity: the thing which is having properties and behaviours is called as real time entity.
this real time entity is represent as a class in java.

properties : the things which are using to identify or represents entity thse==ose are called as preoperties, 
tho properties are represents as a attributes in java ,
by using properties we can represents state of the object.

behaviours: the functionality or activities of enity are called as behaviours.

these behaviours of the entity are represents as methods in java.
by using methods we can achive the activies or functions of entity .

Object : instance of Entity is called as object. object is a real thing for that catagory, these objects we can see and we can touch it. but catogies we cant see or we cant touch.

in java we can create object by using "new" operator. 

   Syntax : 
         ClassName refVar = new ClassName();
		 
		  Person p1  = new Person(); -> person class object.
		  Animal a1 = new Animal();
		  Address a2 = new Address();
		  
		  here new Perosn() -> is called as person class object
		  p1 -> ref variable : if we want to do any comunication with that object we shoud use this ref var. 
		  new : key word it act like father 
		  className() : this is called as constructor , it is act like mother , it will give the initial state for the object. 
		  
		  
          
for example:
    if we take person as a entity 
	  it will contains following properties and behaviours
	  
	    properties :  age, name, height, weight, color , address etc...
		behaviours : running capacity, eating capacity , learning capacity etc.
		
		
		Person.java
		class Person   --- Entity/class
		{  
		   // attributes or properties
     		int age;
		    String name;
			double height;
			double weight;
			String color;	
			
			// method or behaviours
			public double getRunRate(){
			
			   double runRate = (height * weight) / age;
			   
			   return runRate;
			}	  
		   
		}
		
		PersonManager.java
		=========================
		public class PersonManager{
		   public static void main(String args[]){
		      /// create object for person class 
			  
			  Person p1 = new Person();  			  
			  
			  p1.age = 24;
			  //p1.age ="abc";//CTE
			  p1.name = "Tharun";
			  p1.height = 5.6;
			  p1.weight = 55.0;
			  p1.color = "brown";
			  
			  double tharunRunRate  = p1.getRunRate(); // 5.6*55.0/24 = 12.8 
			  
			  System.out.println("Tharun details");
			  System.out.println("Name:"+p1.name);
			  System.out.println("age:"+p1.age);
			  System.out.println("height:"+p1.height);
			  System.out.println("Weight:"+p1.weight);
			  System.out.println("color:"+p1.color);
			  System.out.println("RunRate:"+tharunRunRate);
			  
			  Person p2 = new Person();
			  p2.age = 24;
			  p2.name = "sai";
			  p2.height = 5.5;
			  p2.weight = 66.0;
			  p2.color = "gold";
			  
			  double saiRunRate  = p2.getRunRate(); //(5.5*66.0)/24 = 15.125
			  
			  System.out.println("Sai details");
			  System.out.println("Name:"+p2.name);
			  System.out.println("age:"+p2.age);
			  System.out.println("height:"+p2.height);
			  System.out.println("Weight:"+p2.weight);
			  System.out.println("color:"+p2.color);
			  System.out.println("RunRate:"+saiRunRate);
		   }
		}
		
		Here: 
		new : operator it will create new object with the help of constructor 
		. : access operator , it will help us to access any member of class like attributes or methods,  for either setting the values or getting or reading the values.
		
			   p1.name = "k7it"; // here we are accesing the name attribute from p1 object and setting value as k7it.
			   
			   sop(p1.name);// here we are reading  the name attirbute value from p1 object.
			   
	   Person() : this is called as constructor. 
			   
	    = : assigment operator : it will help us to assing right value into lefgt side variable or attribtes 
		
		+ : this operator will perform 2 operations for us 
		    1. if both the values are numeric it will give sum of those 2 values as result .
			  
			     10+20 -> 30
			2. if any one of the value is string or alphanumeric then it will perform 
			   just simple concatination of two values as one value .
			   
			    "abc"+10 = abc10
				"abc"+"xyz" = abcxyz
				"10"+"20" = 1020
				20+"abc" =  20abc
				
			// -> single line comment 
			/* */ -> multi line comment 
			
			/ -> backward slash
			\ -> forward slash
